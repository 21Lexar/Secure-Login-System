## **Key Features:**

**Secure Data Encryption:** The system provides login and register options for the user, protected by an encrypted password.

**Two-Factor Authentication:** The user will receive an OTP via email, which will be keyed in the OTP section to authenticate the system to register a new account for the user or allow the login of an existing account.

## **Available Options**

**Registration**: Register a new account with your email and a password;

**Login:** login into an existing account and verify if the email is already registered;

**Encryption:** Usersâ€™ password are encrypted into cipher text;

**Verification:** Matches the email with the same stored password;

**OTP:** Auto-generated OTP is received in the email to authenticate the use;
